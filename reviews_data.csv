Our room was large and very clean. The hotel bar had a good selection of wine and very friendly bartenders. We had access to the Executive Lounge. It was nice because you can have wine or beer the entire time the lounge is open. The breakfast options were pretty good, but I was disappointed that there weren't any warm options (e.g. scrambled eggs), but the croissants were excellent! During happy hour, you can get a complementary cheese plate, which was pretty incredible! It was a great selection of a variety of cheeses and breads. The only downside was this was the snack every night, after two of them, we did feel like we were living on cheese and would have enjoyed an alternative.

When I returned late night the bag was there and it was a mini celebration of sorts by the staff. The Staff at the restaurant during breakfast were efficient and always helpful. The bar was another great place to chill with friendly staff. Likewise the check out was smooth. I would like to single out two staff members Ms JuliaStar who handled the check in smoothly and helped in the baggage and also helped in all sorts of ways like arranging two cartons for my extra baggage etc and Ms Beau who handled check out so smoothly and insisted in helping me with loading of bags in the Taxi.

One thing to note right up front is that this is *not* a place for anyone who dislikes stairs, has a lot of heavy luggage, or (I guess) has small children to deal with. Just to get into the reception area you'll need to climb about a dozen stairs, and depending on which floor your room is on you will have to climb a further 1-3 sets of narrow and very steep steps to get there - no lifts!

For the price of just 10.00 EUR you get to choose from an all you can eat continental buffet with freshly baked croissants and dark bread every morning.

1,,6.0,False,"I really did not want this review. In fact I tried contacting them directly to try to get to their customer service representative and write a complaint, but they never responded or attempted to rectify the problem. Here is my warning about this place, you will be treated like crap. My friend accidentally got 2 rooms because they send a confirmation twice and they told her they would not refund her the room (even though it was their system - strike #1). Since my husband and I were meeting her there, we took the room. I called in advance because we were bringing our dog (we live in Poland at the moment) and the manager said while they don't accept the dogs as long as the dog was friendly and quiet (which our dog is) it would be totally not a problem. We checked in and there was no problem...until the next day. We took our small dog out for his walk and when we came back in, the lady (with black hair and glasses) would not let me walk through. I explained to her that I had called and told her the story. She said she would call a supervisor, which was honestly fine. The sales manager came I explained the situation and she said ""well if that's what they told you that's fine"". We dropped our dog off and went out to get a quick breakfast. The lady at the front desk harrassed me again and even locked the doors on me. She told me I could not leave the dog in the room unattended. I told her again that I was not informed. And that's when she yelled and called me a liar in front of the whole lobby of people. I could not believe that was happening. She told me I was lying about talking to someone and them telling me it was ok. I am a paying customer and honestly if they had said no, you can't bring the dog I would have gladly gotten a room at a different hotel or paid an additional deposit. The only reason I am writing this review is because I have seen other patrons mentioning this very same person in reviews. Anyway, I told her to open the door and give me a break. I was so upset, we went got a cup of coffee and went to get my dog (which in the end was fine) apparently not everyone is amsterdam hates dogs like this lady. Before I left for site seeing, I told the lady to speak to her colleague who had worked on the day and time that I called, before she calls me a liar again. When I come back from site seeing, I get a note from the hotel saying that I have violated the rules and not only brought a dog but also left him unattended AND if that happened again they would remove him from the premises. The worst part is that they had contacted their colleague and supervisor and they confirmed our conversation. Even after that she made it a point to make my stay there impossible. The guy at the front desk apologized and I provided a note which detailed that my dog is actually a support animal. He was very apologetic and left a note for others at front desk. He was actually a decent person. I was actually hoping to talk to people at the hotel so that at the very least this lady is retrained because she puts ""spit"" on ""hospitality"". I would have liked to talked with them directly. The next day she never apologized. Horrible, if you can afford it, please stay somewhere else. You will be mistreated, and if you do decide to stay there, watch out for this horrible unpleasant woman.

Here is why:While the receptionist was probably one of the most accommodating, and helpful ones I've met, the hotel simply needs more upkeep. I've stayed in hotels houses in old heritage buildings and yet they never found this an excuse to neglect making the inside as clean and comfortable as possible. I've been to hostels which are much more presentable than this. I would have let the old greying carpet slide or the cheaply painted walls but the killer was the bed which had a dirt smudge under the pillow and the smell of a bed and pillows when you've not changed the sheets for more than a week when it's summer. Worse of all is the itch that me and my friend got a few minutes after laying down on bed. We didn't stay more than an hour. We've seen enough to pack our bags and literally run. Good thing we could book another hotel and was so surprised to get into an SPG hotel for just a few euros more. It is true that we didn't give them a chance to find us another room or perhaps change the sheets but I think we've seen enough.

I didn't insist because that's the bargain I paid for when I booked a prepaid room in booking.comJust thought I'd let others know of my experience so they come into the hotel with open eyes unlike me who didn't read the reviews before coming in.It is true though that the location is excellent and the heritage building is awesome.

When speaking to the reception, in the end said that there was nothing they could do.

The staff then went on to call the cleaners which they obviously replied by saying they saw no money in the room.

5,,109.0,False,"I completely enjoyed my stay here having stayed here for 14 nights in Room 204 (Double Bed with Balcony). It was perfect for me and it went above and beyond what I wanted and needed it to do as a hotel for me. First and foremost, the balcony overlooking Raadhuisstraat was what really made it special and it was the main reason I chose this hotel. I loved overlooking the Keizersgracht, Westerkerk, and seeing and hearing the city life. I loved waking up to the sounds and sights and I loved going to bed to the same. I'm a sucker for a hotel with a balcony. However, if you are a light sleeper, then you might not want a room overlooking Raadhuisstraat because it may be noisy for you. I'm a heavy sleeper, so it was no issue. I loved the sights and sounds of the city though. You will also hear Westerkerk's clock tower, which I thought was amazing. The staff were all completely professional, helpful, polite, friendly, and very quick with any request. The breakfast they serve is small (breads, croissants, coffee, teas, cheese, yogurts, cakes), but it kept me well satisfied. The stairs have been mentioned in every review here, so do you really need to read about them at length one more time? The stairs were no bother to me though, none whatsoever. But, if you have mobility issues, then you will have a decision to make. The location of Nadia could not have been any better for me. For me, it was centrally located and the longest walk for me was the Museum District at about 20 minutes (though I walk fast). Everything else was under a 10 minute walk. There are several restaurants, cafes, tourist sites, a small Albert Heijn within 1 minute, and a massive Albert Heijn within 4 minutes. The tram stops were close by too. Again, location was perfect. The only thing that I can think about that I think I'd like to see them improve is the Wi-Fi speed. At times, the wi-fi speed was perfect, but other times, it was sluggish. This is not a huge issue to me whilst on vacation, but it would be nice if it was faster. The rooms are relatively small, but for me, again, it was fine. For you, I don't know. Frankly, I don't go on holiday to spend my holiday in the hotel all of the time. Last point is smoking, and this is a very commonly asked question, particularly in Amsterdam, so I think it should be covered. The hotel's smoking policy is as follows (as was stated to me by staff at check-in): Smoking anything inside is against policy. Simple. Smoking tobacco is indeed permitted on the balconies. Smoking cannabis on the balconies is against the hotel policy; however, having said this, I assure you that it is done as I smelled it many of times. One must remember that this is Amsterdam and ""tolerance"" is a word one should learn and practice when in this lovely city, just as the natives do. You wouldn't visit a brewery if you hated the smell of beer, would you? So, whether you smoke tobacco, cannabis, or neither...this should answer your questions relative to that issue. I don't often give perfect ratings, but this hotel, with all things considered, easily deserved this perfect rating from me. So much do I like this hotel that I am booking it again for 10 nights next spring. That, if nothing else, should testify to how high I rate this hotel.

A thin long window that opens for some air in the room. Cleaning team are great and very accommodating. The reception team are also very welcoming. Super big and comfortable bed. Clean towels and bedding if needed as well as a restock of toiletries, tea, coffee etc each day. This hotel is in a great location. Very easy to get to, close to the centre of town but far enough not to feel on top of it all constantly. As you come out of the (station side) exit from Amstel station (the side where Burger King is) walk to the left, the hotel is across the road diagonal from the station. The area is quiet and a mix of business and residential.Lidl and a local supermarket - 5 min walk from the hotel. Fantastic for keeping costs down.2 places of a must to visit in the city centre are: Tweede Kamer and Chao Phraya! Both top class places. Travel info to the hotel from Central Station:Intercity (train) to Amstel station (1 stop - 8 mins) or the Metro (underground) is easy, Line 51, 53, 54 all from central station to Amstel station (approx 6 stops - approx 10 mins) the metro is much more frequent than the train. The Metro can be found outside Central train station, the entrance is marked with a blue M with stairs leading down. A 3 day Amsterdam travel card €26 will get you from the airport to the hotel and all around/ back and forth to the city centre/canal ring (it can be used on the trains, metro, and trams around Amsterdam - well worth the money as each journey costs at least €2.60 without it). You use it like an oyster. Make sure you tap in and out of the correct barrier if using the metro use the metro gate - metro and train gates are in the same place. Bad points (after all there are always some):Toilet seat was dirty - not a nice start but needed washing.Some kind of splash marks over the tiles near the toilet - definitely not water!!Spilled drink (I hope) on the side in the bedroom. Mould/Black in the shower/sealant, and the sink was well used. Cleaners start early, not very relaxing with hoovers etc outside the room at the weekend.

4,Responded 4 weeks ago,5.0,False,"We went over NYE and had ticket for upstairs club included in our rate, after booking we were emailed offering to book a place for dinner too. The dinner was delicious! Esp the banana trifle to go in with the 'go bananas theme'. The music wasn't really our thing but we made the most of it, but the most amazing part of it was standing on the rooftop viewing the fireworks going off all around you as it turned to midnight, it was quite a 'wow' moment. Great views of the city from that floor and I would recommend to anyone who was thinking of going over NYE. Very friendly welcome from reception on our arrival. Handy map of good local places provided. We had a coffee in the bar on arrival which was very nice and relaxing atmosphere after travelling. Hotel is in a very handy location to just jump on and off the tube, a short ride to central amsterdam for some sightseeing. We did wander around the area of the hotel and found a nice park and there is a few restaurants opposite too, but otherwise I don't think there is much more in the area (although we only had a short stay so might have missed it) Our room was nice, we did pay for a lower rate room so weren't expecting much but it was comfortable and clean. Although our parents thought it was ""unfinished"" when they saw photos, but it was all part of the vibe of the hotel in my opinion and I liked it. So I guess it depends on your taste. The fire alarm went off on our first night at 3am as a false alarm, never pleasant but sometimes happens, the hotel had signs up in the corridors offering a free breakfast to apologise. Which I thought was a very nice gesture and a delicious buffet breakfast was provided! Which made up for having to get our of bed at 3am! Tip: the breakfast club just down the road from the hotel does a delicious breakfast/lunch too! Also I would recommend trying the hot tubs on the rooftop, it was freezing cold day when we went but was great to go up there and sit in the warm tubs looking over at the city. There is also a sauna. Although make sure you have a euro for the lockers, we asked lady who was at the bar there but she couldn't give us any change and said we would have to go to the restaurant but we were already in our swimwear by then!

The bar on the ground level is perfect for having beers and meeting other guests and locals (many visit here). Downstairs there’s a basement night bar where they serve delicious cocktails and a DJ plays funky music. Upstairs on the 7th floor the restaurant – which later turns into a club – offers amazing views over the city. And the food is delicious but simple. The club offers a lot of local DJs which guarantees a night full of dancing with friends and strangers.The staff is super friendly, they will welcome you with opens arms and big smiles. And give you amazing tips of what to see and to do in the neighborhood and the rest of Amsterdam. You really notice they know what they’re doing and that they love working there. No work attire here, they wear whatever they like. Sometimes resulting in somewhat flamboyant outfits – love it. Lots of friendly hellos and goodbyes from them every time I came and went.The subway is literally a few meters away from the hotel which gives you easy access to the city center. Around the hotel there are many convenience stores and other bars (might you want to leave the hotel after all). The surrounding ‘Oost’ neighborhood offers a lot of cool bars, café’s and cool places to check out.

There is a very efficient tran and metro station right on the doorstep of the hotel- never more than a 3 minute wait for a metro right to the city centre. It only ever took us 20 minutes max to get to anywhere we wanted to go. Supermarket and wine store right beside hotel. Very handy. Hotel lobby/ staff: Hotel lobby is a busy and delightful place. Always a buzz about the place- can get snacks and drinks at the bar down stairs and relax. Bar is open late which is helpful if you want a night cap. Staff were friendly, helped us order food online when we got back late and were hungry. Hotel restaurant: The hotel has a restaurant on the top floor. We are there the night we arrived. Very wholesome Dutch food. Wasn’t to our taste, but was a nice experience. Bit expensive in our opinion for what it was. Views very nice. Room: Room was stylish and clean. Grand size with a tv mounted on the wall. Bed was comfy, only one pillow each but we asked for more and they were happy to oblige. I didn’t like the bathroom system. There was a clear glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom. This did have a pattern on it which concealed most of a persons body but could still see head and lower leg. I was staying there with my boyfriend, so I didn’t overly mind about the shower- however I did mind when using the toilet. We’re in love and all that- but definitely still want privacy when on the toilet. Room was well lit, had black blinds which kept out the light in the morning and helped us sleep in. Housekeeping: We stayed three nights. What I felt let the hotel down the most was the house keeping. The rubbish was never emptied/ floor hoovered or toiletries were never replaced. All that was done was toilet paper restocked and if needed towels were replaced. Bed was never touched or floor cleaned. This was a massive let down for us- especially with the rubbish. We had no where to put it! The place began to smell. Electrics: TV had a HDMI, VGA and usb input. These were very inaccessible at the back of the tv- hard if you are trying to hook up a laptop. Tv had a good selection of channels. Hairdryer was terrible- bring your own.Overall: Overall we were very happy. We paid €310 for three nights- this included a late check out.

First, renting out the chapel for New Year’s Eve to a disco/party organizer called Hed Kandi may be part of a multi-use business model but hotel guests shouldn’t be inconvenienced or marginalized by a one-off event.Second, while we found our room mostly comfortable (the bed was divine) and enjoyed the view of a canal, the room design is flawed. Enclosing the bathroom in tinted glass may look good but doesn’t work well in reality. Even couples who have been together for a long time prefer privacy in the toilet. The bathroom lighting is impossible for applying makeup and the single outlet there doesn’t work for anything other than a shaver. There were no drawers, so we had to keep our suitcases on the sofa to access our clothes. And the wall that served as a headboard and room divider was not attached well to the floor and rocked back and forth when we tried to sit up in bed to read.No doubt the management will address these issues in time, as Hotel Arena is still a fairly new enterprise, and future guests will enjoy their stays as much as we did.",105.0,"January 10, 2018","Gracious staff, elegant hotel",,,julia m,"long island, new york",{},NA,,True

The tram location was a big part of the problem as they passed by our room (070) from early early in the morning till midnight ringing bell and rattling by (sounded like a plane taking off) This something that can’t be helped but people should be wary of when being given their room. The rooms in that corridor (new wing) are awful.The noise level is outrageous, the delivery bay was right outside our window and you would have sworn they were in the room throwing things around. First thing every morning the lorries would arrive banging trolleys, throwing stage and music equipment into lorries. I’ve never experienced anything like this wherever I’ve stayed.We tolerated the noise all week from the deliveries however on the final night we stayed the hotel was hosting a private function( which they told us the do every Thursday Friday and Saturday night). The pounding music went on all through the night, we did not get a single minute sleep. To add insult to injury at 8.30am they started loading all the metal staging and music equipment into the lorry outside our window. When I approached staff I spoke with the manager Alexander and another staff member who were very dismissive saying their was nothing they could do as the hotel had been booked for a private function and they couldn’t help the noise all night or stop them loading their equipment. They were totally uninterested in my complaint. The refused to compensate us for the previous night and advised all they could do was give us a free breakfast and wave the 20 pound city tax.They were not interested in us as paying customers as they obviously bring in a lot more money from private functions.Be wary when booking here as they have these functions from thu to sun.Be wary of the rooms in the new wing, our room 070 at the delivery bay. Also the rooms have very poor soundproofing, constantly hear fire doors slamming during the night. I heard several other guests complain about the noise levels also.And if you do have a genuine complaint the staff won’t want to know.The rooms are okay, very steep stairs to the bed mezzanine which didn’t trouble us but may be an issue for others. If it hadn’t been for the noise and the terrible attitude of the staff then we would have probably had a lovely time.

3,,81.0,False,"I've stayed at 3 other Dam hostels once each, and a budget hotel chain many times in many visits over the years-thought I'd give a hostel another shot for 3 nights alone and female when a sudden break came up. Before I stayed at flying pig uptown and downtown and also at The Generator down by Westerpark. I say for comparison. This one was near Leidseplein / Vondlepark which I like area the most, and not as far as The Generator (by far the best for many reasons). On arrival it was 7pm and a lovely quiet area and street (I'd read about the school opposite but no noise for now). Vondlepark is literally 5 min walk and the Leidseplein is probably 10/12min-lots of bars and shopping and coffeeshops not quite as pricey as near the station. High end shopping and eating just round corner too including Chanel, Buberry, Tiffany etc. Check In was easy - I was in an 8 bed dorm and was feeling brave even though I was alone. There is a toilet and sink in a lockable room down and off to reception if you fancy changing before u go in ur room if it's late. There was a seating area in reception with tables and chairs where they serve 5euro breakfast if you want it. I didn't fancy it. There is also a couple of benches for smokers of all kinds outside front of hotel which is likely not allowed when school is in play as the kids literally spread from the school opposite to outside the hotel door and the little street it's on! It's right up against the hotel so if you sleep lightly, probably not best for you - not sure if rooms on the back are quieter - I had Dutch ear plugs from the Etos chemists they have out here and they are excellent at keeping out noise along with an eye mask for deep sleep so I wasn't bothered but when I took out the plugs on first morning it was insanely loud! I went up and there were four bunk beds - I was in room 108 and bed G. I couldn't find my shelf or safe and didn't want to disturb the dozing man on one bed. Don't think I had any shelf in the end so used the desk in the room. There was a flat screen tv on the wall although it never went on. Toilet and shower wasn't too noisy even though it was right in room. Felt safe enough to leave my back pack on bed under quilt. Valuables with me. When I came back at 1am it was a full sleeping room with lights off however I'd left stuff handy for a quick change to bed and so I wasn't too noisy. The bed does have a plug that allows a normal length phone lead to reach you when lying down at pillow, and if needed there's a little light for each bed too. Bed mattress was comfy and clean and not too creaky. In morning I met two nice Spanish speaking girls and an Irish chap who was very nice. The shower you do have to wait for but as it was now only 4 of us it wasn't long. Nice to have shower in room for change - no other hostel has. But on 2nd morning I did have to wait desperate for a wee whilst a lovely American guy had a shower. Not ideal but guess it depends how much you need it when you wake up! Shower was hot and clean! Yes lack of air circulation means lots of condensation and a not so clean feel but what can you do for £30 odd a night. There was basic shower gel in there along with usual hostel left over products from guests. Both nights were comfy and not too to weird or awkward, I slept through a lot. However I did choose to leave one night early to get my own room nearby at a hotel. I just fancied a more relaxed evening with some tv even though the guests I had met were lovely. Out of the 4 places I probably wouldn't stay again-it had no character or coolness. The FP hostels are old and hot and creaky and a bit smelly but have loads of Dam character and are very social and party atmosphere (especially downtown). The Generator is new and shiny and very cool in a modernised old college and excellent value - just a fair bit further a walk from station than I wanted this time with back pack (50min, although can catch Trams that come near by ish the hostel). It was just a bed in a room full of nice people that's good if you want the museum quarter and a more quiet time, except for the school kids that is.

The hotel is modern and funky in decor, clean, friendly staff and little touches added. The hotel is out of the centre but to be honest suited us and there are trams/buses galore to explore the city. Plenty of coffee shops/restaurants around with the no 9 tram right outside. I just loved the coffee machine (those pods went every day!) and the comfortable bed. A little fridge to put water/milk in came in very handy. There was a mobile device to use around the city but as no roaming charges I used my own phone. Flat screen TV with limited channels but BBC 1 and 2 listed. Bathroom was lovely, comfortable bath with toiletries included. We were on the side, third floor and to be honest could be loud at times so would have a room on the back next time. Room service was lovely but menu quite limited especially after 10pm and a service charge will be included. We ate in the restaurant one night but found the menu quite restrictive and not good for children. A dish was offered to my daughter however. My dish was very tasty but too small a portion (got a big appetite!). I did find the restaurant staff very distant....we ordered a main course and wasn’t asked if it was ok or if we wanted any more drinks. Got fed up of waiting for desert so left as we were there an hour and a half. Wouldn’t use the restaurant on our return to be honest.

The taxi drivers in the city centre really made us feel uncomfortable and unsafe, following us around and shouting comments as we would walk past. Simply we refused to use their services.

1,"Responded January 15, 2018",1.0,False,"I am writing in regards to an incident that occurred during my stay in your hotel this week. When me and my partner came back from our lunch on Wednesday afternoon we found a note on the bed informing us we had to pay a 150 euro smoking fine upon check out. I went down to reception to ask why I had gotten his fee due to the fact that I never once smoked in the room and the lady behind the desk informed me that “there was an obvious smell of marijuana” to which I told them I had been in the smoking cafe all day and they informed me that there was an obvious difference. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told she wasn’t available and to come back the following day. I returned the following day to and asked to speak to the manager again and was told that she was not around but she was the supervisor and I could speak to her. I repeated that I had not smoked in the room and asked how there could be such a smell. I mentioned that on a previous occasion I had stayed in a hotel in Ireland and had used my vape out the window before bed as it helped me sleep and that never caused a problem so why would simply having items in the room smelling like marijuana cause such an issue, the supervisor immediately attempted to accuse me of “changing my story” and explained that they had pictures proving their case. I asked to see these photos and they showed me two photos of the window in the room looking condensed and a packet of skins on the ground. This ‘evidence’ is almost comical, how one can be accused of smoking in a room based on a condensed window and a packet of skins on the ground is almost con-like. Secondly I’d like to point out that taking photos of my room and personal belongings while I am staying in the room is a blatant breach of privacy. To continue, the supervisor advised me to come back the following morning and speak to the manager. Both members of staff were incredibly rude and dismissive and were quick to make accusations on matters they knew nothing about. On the final day I went down to reception to speak to the manager and I explained again how I had not once smoking in the room. She smugly pointed out about the photos and how I had “changed my story” and “admitted to smoking out the window”, to which I did neither. When I told her that I did not intend to pay the fee because I did not smoke in the room and was being wrongly accused, she told me it would have to be paid if we did not pay it she would be taking it off my card. I told her she had no authorization to take further payments on my card and she responded by telling me that I had signed an agreement form. When I told her I had never signed any form she pulled it out from a folder and showed me the name Of a friend who travelled with us and stayed in in a different rooms signature. The friend of ours whom we travelled with had signed for both rooms. We should have each signed and been given the opportunity to read the conditions of the hotel, a clear error by the manager. When I pointed out that it wasn’t my signature I was told that it didn’t matter and that I would have to pay simple as. Her mannerisms and complete arrogance appalling and I find the fact that these accusations were made based on a packet of skins on the ground and a condensed window almost con-like and borderline discriminative.

We have stayed in a lot of 4 star hotels and this one is on a par with a lot of them.The rooms are the average size for a city hotel and came with all the usual toiletries ,tea/coffee making facilities(no milk though) and flat screen. The bed pillows are more cushion size but we asked for 2 extra ones and they were quickly delivered to our room.We found the beds and pillows actually very comfortable.The room was cleaned spotlessly every day and the wifi worked fine for us on the second floor.The bathroom does have glass panels which seems to be the fashion these days so maybe not as private as some people would like but to be honest you would have to be lying on the floor to see anything.Not being keen on continental breakfast we decided to eat out on the first 2 mornings thinking we would get better value but soon realised we had made a mistake and paid the 15 euros on the 3rd day and wish we had done that before.We paid almost that amount in the local bars, but in the restaurant we could drink and eat as much as we wanted of fresh fruit,cereals,toast,pastries cold meats,cheeses and cooked items including fried eggs and omelettes cooked to order.Location wise it was good being about 25 minutes or so walk to the station and most attractions being within a mile or 2.Hiring a bike(one shop right by the canal entrance to the hotel)is a great way of getting round as the roads are very flat and bike friendly and you can stop wherever you want for photos etc. The only bad point I would raise was the room mini bar/fridge. Apparently if you use or even just move any of the items in there you could be charged for them even if you dont use them as they are electronically monitored and if you want all the items removed you have to pay a 15 euro fee.

So the receptionist explained us that the hotel gave the room as the reservation was arriving but I do not understand how you can have double room available, sell it more expensive than a single one and give a single to the customer ? So we had the first night and we moved to the room 205 on the 26th which was a double. The second morning we noticed there was a smell in the room we looked around and found butter and milk opened that was left from the previous customer by the window behind the curtains ! Once again don't you have a cleaning person who is supposed to clean the rooms before selling them ??? Finally on our last night we started to hear noise by 10pm and at 12 being in bed we could hear people continusly walking around in the bedroom above which is very unpleasant as the building is not new so we could hear the floor squeak. So at 1am I took the chance to go to the reception for ask the receptionist if he could do something about this uncomfortable situation as I am sorry but when I come to a hotel it’s for sleep not to walk around… So the receptionist went to the room above and told me that the customers were seated on the floor and they would try to make less noise.Right after this we heard the clients JUMPING in the room as a « thank you for sending the receptionist but clearly we don’t care !». So I went back to the reception with my boyfriend and the receptionist said he would go back to the room above us and send the clients out as we were paying for the room and the situation was not normal and he would give us a call to our room to tell us.So then started the longest 15 minutes of our life, we have been waiting for the receptionist to call us which he never did ! So after wondering what happened to the guy we finally took the decision to call down to reception and the receptionist just said that the clients said they would calm down which they never did !! So I asked for another room and we had to pack ALL OF OUR BELONGINGS at 2 am in the morning because you are not capable of managing your own hotel !! The hotel is just dirty, it's nice to have carpet but you still need to wash it ....We paid 260€ for our stay and this is a lot of money to stay somewhere to sleep and not being able to do so.

2,,13.0,False,"In a world where WIFI has to be available, to research restaurants, and tourist sites for most up to date information, to get ones bearings, and to communicate with friends who might be nearby, this hotel has proven an abject failure. The WIFI connection dropped in and out frustratingly frequently, making even the writing of this review a challenge. This, coupled with the fact that the very presentable, neat and tidy rooms DO NOT include simple extras like a kettle to make a cup of tea, an iron to press ones clothes, or a proper chest of draws to unpack into, or a working house phone, or any phone for that matter, and this potentially great little hotel loses all its bonus points for having lovely friendly staff. What's more the stairs are so authentically ""Amsterdam"" that the climb in the morning and at night, and any other time one comes back to the hotel room, ensures that a good physical work out is always on offer. That's fine for us young and healthy sixty five year olds, but I have friends joining the hotel who are slightly more fragile, with bad backs and knees, who specifically asked if access were easy, and who are therefore going to be extremely disappointed. Adding to our discomfort, the breakfast on offer to the house guests leaves much to be desired. The cheap pork chipolatas, over cooked scrambled eggs and processed cheese and ham, along with an assortment of packet cereals are barely adequate. The fresh fruit was the best on offer. I don't expect a five star menu but I think they could offer a choice of eggs!Amsterdam is very expensive, but one usually gets reasonable value for money. This is not the case here.

5,"Responded January 21, 2018",48.0,False,"For us we thought the Hampton by Hilton was in a perfect location for our visit to Amsterdam.The Hotel is in a square with a mix of retail, commercial,residental,bars, Imax cinema and a sport stadium.. With the station only a two minute walk from the entrance of the hotel this really suited us as it was very easy to get to and from the airport and equally easy to get into Amsterdam central.The intercity train from Schipol airport took about 14 minutes to get to Bijlmer Arena and the metro into Amsterdam Centraal took about 16 minutes. We used a Amsterdam 3 day travel ticket which gives you unlimited travel on buses,trams and metro in Amsterdam plus also giving you the train journey to and from Schipol airport to any station in Amsterdam. This cost 26 euros and was booked/paid for online at Discover Holland.com. You then take your printed confirmation to a AKO bookstore at Schipol Airport to get your tickets.The tickets do expire at 4am in the moring after the third day so we had buy a single ticket to the airport which cost 4.20 euros and can be printed off at home to use.We did think the transport system was excellent and really cheap.We really liked the decor of the hotel and the friendly welcome we received from staff. Actually all the staff for our long weekend were great and it was nice to see lots of smiley faces everyday.Our room was 327 which faced the square and office block, the view was perfectly fine for us. The room was very clean with two twin beds which were very comfortably. It was quite a large room with high ceilings maybe could have done with something to in either corner by the beds to put luggage on or even a extra seat.The bedroom was fairly standard size with a really excellent large shower.We didn't need our room cleaning for one day so we were left fresh towels hanging on our door handle when we returned from our day out which was a really nice touch.Breakfast was excellent, lots to choose from and plenty to eat/drink.

The room I was in was large by Amsterdam standard by kind of small for what I'm used to for this brand in the US. Breakfast was the usual Hampton fare and replenished often. The hotel is busy with business professionals on weekdays and very busy on weekends with discounted rates that swell capacity/occupancy. Friday and Sundays might be days to avoid it looking for a late check out - early check in, in my case my request for an early check in was rudely declined with the clerk not even looking up. Actually, this clerk made me feel uncomfortable throughout my stay where as the other staff were most pleasant and accommodating. They will store your luggage is necessary. Would I stay here again? As a leisure traveler I would only stay here if I were attending an event at the ArenA. With the area more of a corporate area I felt out of place.

First, my room had a private area for the toilet, but the shower and sink area were only divided from the rest of the room by a glass wall. Depending on who else you’re sharing the room with, privacy could be an issue. Second, there are no power outlets (or alarm clock) by the bed. The room comes with a battery pack charger for your phone, so you can bring that near the bed. However, if you like to watch Netflix on your laptop in bed like I do, you’ll likely need to do this on battery power. Third, the floor area around bed area is raised. You get out of bed on the raised floor area, then need to take a small step down. The step has a small light on it, but I still managed to miss it on my first jet-lagged night there, and ended up rolling over my ankle. Fortunately, I was fine, but something to keep in mind if you’re prone to these sorts of things. Lastly, this hotel is not very central. It’s about 15-20 euros to take a taxi from the hotel to the main canal areas of the city. All that being said, it’s a modern, fresh hotel with cool art on the walls, and a more interesting vibe than some of the more standard hotels.",10.0,"December 3, 2017",Modern hotel - not super central,,,ChrisAndKarenJ,"Vancouver, Canada",{},NA,,False

That is fine, its a hotel nothing is perfect or always ready when you want it to be. 2pm rolls around and we speak to the guy behind the desk. We are told that on TOP of the moey we had already spent on the hotel, we needed to give them 100 Euro's as a deposit....for what??? we already paid for our rooms as WELL as the tourist tax upon arrival . So we had to brag ourselves over to an ATM to covert even more money just to pay for a deposit for a room we already paid for.Are then told that you have to return the room key EVERYTIME you leave the building. Imagine leaving everytime to go and explore and theres a queue at the reception area and you need to stand and wait to return a key. They claim its ''really old school'' no its just annoying.We didnt pay big bucks for the room so we wasnt expecting much but however the already low bar was made even lower when we walked into the room. When I say it was like a dust/sand storm im not joking. My allergies have never flared up quite like that. I places my phone down, came back a few moments later and the whole thing is covered in dust. They placed us DIRECTLY next to the lift. The lift in itself is just incapale of doing the smallest of jobs, however hearing the lift go up and down up and down all night with all sorts of people leaving and entering it, wasnt eh most pleasant. I hear a couple breakup and make up in one night because of where our room was. We were ever so kindly woekn up every morning to the sounds of engineering work and drills and god knows what else humming away for what seemed like hours. This should have been told to us beforehand, however it wasnt.And finally the cherry on top, the less than capable 'night guard' that checked us out. Our flights were early so we had to be out and ready to leave for 3.45am. We go downstairs to find the night guard face down on the hotel desk fast asleep. He then suddenly jolts awake and isnt even fully with it whilst checking us out. He mumbles in broken sentences and hands us our 100 euro deposit back and heads right back to putting his head on the desk and its right back to sleep he went.

At the check in they briefly gave us information on Amsterdam and places to go visit. Both check in and check out was smooth and easy, no hassle, no fuss.

You are served a continental breakfast, and cereal every morning, with choices of coffee, tea, apple and orange juices to drink from. However during my entire time in Amsterdam, I thoroughly enjoyed coming home to the hotel after a long full day of walking the streets and alleyways of Amsterdam ((especially in the bitter cold)) to a warm, cozy room. You are always welcomed with warmth from this hotel, and 100% guaranteed you will get a good night sleep as well.

The loft was up three flights of steep stairs — welcome to Amsterdam — and was cosy and comfortable during our stay. Nice shower, modern fixtures and furnishings. As sometimes with designer spaces, form rose above function, particularly in the bathroom. Not really any counter space to speak of for your toiletry items, and the sink in our loft was super stylish but had nowhere to set things except for directly in the sink. The breakfast was included in our rate because we'd booked a standard room, but is not normally offered in the price of the loft rooms. It was quite lovely and served in the hotel lobby. We only made it down on our last morning, but were happy we did so. Nice selection of rolls, eggs, fresh vegetables, cheeses, and sliced meats. And of course, delicious coffee and tea.

4,,13.0,False,"This hotel is great for its location and the staff and very warm and friendly. The rooms are a little small, however for city breaks such as Amsterdam, you spend very little time in the hotel room so it's perfectly adequate for a good nigh sleep. We arrived before check in time and therefore knew it was unlikely our room would be ready. However the hotel kindly took our bags for us and provided us with a city map and some recommendations for lunch. We then came back at check in time and unpacked in the room. It had a small balcony and a ensuite in the room, a tv and a big comfy bed. There was also plenty of clean towels and a variety of complimentary soaps and showers wash items. The breakfast is continental and very nice indeed. The service at breakfast is very friendly and they are happy to assist with any queries. It's laid out like a buffet style and everything is very fresh. The rolls are very fresh. Whenever you go out, the hotel like you to leave your key at the front desk. This is a good idea as it's quite a big key and key chain so it saves you carrying it around and prevents you losing it. Plus for those drunken nights when you stroll in they are there ready with your key! Pending of course you can remember where you are staying! The location of the hotel is fantastic. We got a taxi from the airport and it cost 45 euros. However you can get the tram to the main station and then the train to the airport which takes about an hour. From the hotel you are about a 10 minute walk from the Heineken experience, about 15 minutes from Van Gogh museum and the museum quarter. Heading from the hotel in the opposite direction, so towards the red light district is about a 25 minute walk. It's about a 30 minute walk to the Ann Frank House.

We got breakfast included which was also great. The room was very nice, clean and big enough for a couple visiting, bed was really comfy too which is rare in most hotels! I can not stress enough how great the location of this hotel is! Around a 20ish minute walk from dam square which is the main city area including the red light district but we got the tram number 4 which takes around 5 minutes, would recommend getting a tram pass as they are so handy for getting around and exploring as your feet will get tired! Also if you head left out of the hotel there is really great areas to eat and also the museum district and Heineken experience. We ate at a restaurant called Mr Tongs twice during our visit and it is so delicious we recommend it for sure!Not so much about the hotel but for anyone visiting some recommendations are:Heineken experience 100%! Even if you're not a fan of beer (like me) it is so fun, there are beer, cheese and Dutch food tasting and also free Heineken and soft drinks at the end which is great for the price of €16! Also great for the kids, lots of interactive photo booths, football rooms, sports rooms and more (we are only 18 and we were in here for ages it was so fun for kids and adults!)Red light Secrets Museum - we visited this and the erotic museum which are both located at the red light district and thought this was great (the erotic museum was really boring, wouldn't recommend at all). You can have a great insight into the women that work on the red light including their rooms, luxury rooms and even get a chance to sit in the window! Ajax Arena Tour - Again I'm not a huge football fan it was for my boyfriends birthday but I had a really fun time, staff were really nice, the tour was in Dutch and English and there was lots of great things to take pictures with.

4,,20.0,False,"The WestCord Fashion Hotel is located slightly out of the city centre but it's an easy walk down to the tram stop and then about 15 mins on the tram to the heart of things - and it is actually walkable to the museum quarter if the weather's ok.We had only limited interaction with the reception staff but when we did speak to them they were friendly and helpful.Our room was very spacious, quiet and had a comfortable bed (firm but not overly so) and good choice of pillows, so we slept well each night of our stay. We were also really happy with the shower - consistent temperature and good water pressure every time.There were a few quirks/things we'd criticise, though:- Hotel hairdryers are never brilliant, but this one was utterly useless - it wheezed and sputtered warm air at me but didn't do much in the way of hair-drying. I didn't complain about it to the hotel because I suspect the solution would have been to move rooms - which would have felt like a faff, and we could have found the hairdryer in any other room to be just as bad. Instead, I chose to spend €15 to buy myself a travel hairdryer in town! - Days 1 and 2, we had no floor towel in the bathroom so the floor got quite wet as the water does splash a little out of the shower enclosure. Day 3 a floor towel appeared (hooray!) but day 4 it disappeared again, only to reappear on day 5. - Days 1, 2 and 3, we had no hand-soap in the bathroom, so used the little complimentary bottle of shower gel as soap when washing our hands. Day 4, a hand-soap appeared, so we used that instead. Day 5, the barely used hand-soap had gone and a new one had been put in its place, which we felt was both odd and a little bit wasteful.- There was a Nespresso coffee machine in the room, which my husband loved and it was always well stocked with coffee pods. There was also a kettle, which was great for me as a tea drinker. But on days 1, 2 and 3, there was no tea (or any other drink you could make using a kettle). Luckily, I travel with my own teabags, so I could still make use of the kettle (subject to the below!). Oddly, teabags did appear on day 4, but were gone again on day 5. - Perhaps it is a peculiarly British thing to take milk in your morning tea. But I do, and I'd imagine many of the hotel's other guests do also. Unfortunately, there was no milk - just coffee creamer, and little pots of ""coffee milk"" - this is not normal UHT milk but evaporated milk, and it really does not work in tea. I would happily have bought my own milk, but there is no fridge in the room so I would have had nowhere to store it. (The minibar is a -presumably refrigerated - vending machine, so doesn't enable guests to store their own things inside it)!- It's called the Fashion Hotel, presumably because it is located just a few mins walk from the World Fashion Centre. But it has taken this to heart in its decor - there are mannequins in various poses and outfits dotted around the public areas.

The breakfast consist of a rather oppe selection of cold cuts, cereal and sweet pastries. Only white bread available. You are supposed to order eggs and coffee from servers. My friend came first, and ordered coffee. When I arrived 15 minutes later, she was still waiting for a coffee. I had to ask for seevice, and ordered coffee and an omelett. My friend finally got to order scrambled eggs. Still no coffee for her, and we had to wait appr. 30 minutes for her coffee to be served, and then we had to correct it two times. My omelett was so over-cooked that it resembled a rubber ball. There were at least four servers and appr 6 guests in the restaurant when we had our breakfast at 09, but still I had to ask them to refill the orange juice pitcher at the buffet. For 22€ pp, this is robbery and a very bad deal. Did have a coffee in the breakfast restaurant another morning, and was served by a very rude woman. Had to wait ten minutes (in a quiet restaurant) for a coffee, before she showed up and asked if I wanted two coffees. I told her I only had ordered one, but she kept asking if I wanted to wait for my friend. I then specifically said I wanted one cup of coffee, for med, right away, and when she replied it would take five minutes (after already waiting ten), I was very surprised.

Sadly, it is not possible to know if you are serviced by an employee or apprentice, and most of the staff is not very helpful when you have a complaint.

The bathroom was fine but main room carpet was dreadful and paint peeling off wall etc. The bed was very comfy though and for the purpose of our visit we couldn't really ask for more in that respect. Issues included not having enough pillows. We arrived late so went down in the evening and asked for an extra pillow. Apparently they wouldn't do this for us as there is only one person on reception. The following morning at 9am I asked for another pillow to be brought for the evening. We returned at 6pm to nothing. So asked again for another pillow and additional water glass for 3 of us.

When we came back later we were provided with our keys and we located our room on the second floor. The room had a terrace overlooking the back of the hotel. The room was the essence of the word 'budget'. We had to say we were surprised there was no smoker smell, which we were dreading.

They never stopped playing their music, this beginning at 4pm on the evening until 5am in the morning. Not only music, but the sound of them giggling and running across our shared terrace made us feel scared and particularly unsafe. My partner, who is a light sleeper, managed no sleep that night and was disappointing as you do not expect this when 'on holiday'. The next day we complained to reception who basically stated that they couldn't do anything about it. Which screamed to me they were to scared too approach them!!! After us pushing the cause, the man on reception had us moved to a room on the top floor overlooking the road. We did have to move out our room by 10am and then leave our luggage in reception until 3pm when we could check back in again. A bit of a process to say the least. This room was a better sleep, but the shared bathroom had its issues. The couple in the room opposite were ALWAYS in the bathroom.

I'd booked a single room with private facilities but was upgraded to the triple room with private facilities. The room had a balcony, which I had requested if possible, so I was really pleased. The rooms were basic, as you'd expect for the price, but they were clean and fresh towels were provided daily. The breakfast was excellent - a good selection of cereals, cold meats (ham and salami), cheese, tomatoes, bread and juices. The room in which breakfast was served was lovely, with a nice view of the street outside to watch the world go by as you ate.There is a big Albert Heijn under the hotel which is great if you're on a budget. The hotel is really close to the Vondelpark, Museumplein and Leidseplein areas, and there is also a tram stop right outside the hotel which will take you towards Centraal if you want to head closer to the centre of the city.I didn't really have much interaction with the staff, but whenever I did they were polite and friendly.The hotel is smoker friendly,which meant I was able to enjoy a smoke on the balcony with no problems. Please don't abuse this - if you visit the hotel, don't smoke in the rooms with the windows shut. Keep the windows open, or smoke on the balcony and hopefully they will keep this policy.The only slight negative would be the amount of stairs. If you have mobility issues then I do not think this is the hotel for you. Having said that, my opinion of the stairs being a negative is more of a reflection on my own personal fitness, rather than a reflection on the hotel.I will definitely stay here again.

5,"Responded August 2, 2017",4.0,False,"Just returned from a few night in the hotel and I cannot recommend it enough. It was simply faultless. The rooms are clean and the staff are professional and friendly. The breakfast came with the room booking so I don't know how much it would cost to pay separately for this but it is very good. Not only was there a wide range of the usual continental fare which in itself would have been more than adequate but there is also bacon, sausages and eggs. There is also free coffee,water and cakes throughout the day and night. The hotel is about 20 mins tram ride from the city centre but don't let that put you off because for about 6 Euros a day you can get unlimited travel and I can assure you that you won't get the same value or service in a city centre hotel for the same price and the trams and buses are run like clockwork.

They provided soap and shampoo but you have to bring your own body lotion and conditioner. The hotel is small with a small reception area and a dining room with a kitchen on the first floor. Complementary tea, coffee, fruits and pastries (leftover from breakfast) are pleasant snacks in the afternoon. Best Western Delphi is located one block from a commercial street with a well stocked supermarket, boutiques, pharmacies, coffee houses, ice cream shops, and restaurants ( I had the best Chinese food at a restaurant 2 blocks away). The Amsterdam museum complex is a 10/15 minute walk away. Buses and trams run daily down the commercial street from Central Station or the Airport. Coming to Amsterdam by train, you can easily catch the #5 or #24 and get off one block away from the hotel, or coming by plane, you can catch the #197 Airport bus with connection to #24.

Beds were very comfy, and we had a quiet room with balcony overlooking some back gardens with mature trees. Staff were very pleasant. When we reported we didn't have any bedside lights, this was remedied promptly. The bin in the bathroom hadn't been emptied prior to our arrival, but this was also dealt with. For me, the breakfast was exceptional, with a great selection of cold meats and cheeses, including a wonderful, thinly sliced peppered beef. Plus eggs, bacon, mushrooms, sausages, potatoes, lovely bread/croissant, fresh fruit, yoghourt cereal and self-serve coffee. However, the breakfast room is rather small for the size of hotel. I had to share a table, which was not a problem, but it was rather cramped. Wifi worked well. We left our cases on the last day until about 5pm, and spent the last hour in the breakfast room chilling out and drinking tea/coffee. All in all a very good experience.
